            <h2>Basic Information</h2>
        <p>Hockey is an exciting sport which is played on a 200 by 85 foot ice rink, and it is played between two teams. 
            Under most circumstsances, there are five skaters and one goalie on the ice at any given time for each team. 
            The game is played with a small, 6 ounce <em>hockey puck</em> which is made of frozen rubber. To move the puck around the ice, players use <em>hockey sticks</em>.
            In order to score, you must try to put the puck into the other teams net which is being guarded by the goaltender.
            </p>
        <h2>Professional Ice Hockey</h2>
            <p>There are many professional hockey leagues throughout the world. The biggest league is the <strong>National Hockey League</strong> <em>(NHL)</em> which is played in North America, and is the top professional league in the world. The NHL consists of 32 teams, 7 from Canada and 25 from the United States.

            <h2>What Makes Hockey Special</h2>
            <p>
                Hockey is special and unique compared to other sports for many reasons, such as the fact that it is the only one of the major sports which is played on ice, which is a large contributor to it's fast pace. It is also very fun because of the physicality, which adds a lot to the intensity of the sport. 
                At every competitive level past a certain age, contact is allowed, and players are allowed to hit other players, as long as it is done so legally. If an illegal hit is made, the offending player will be penalized. Remaining on topic of physicality, professional hockey players are allowd to fight each other, which just adds another aspect of drama to the sport.
